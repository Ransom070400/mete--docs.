# MetaMuse

## Overview
The MetaMuse is a decentralized application that allows artists to collaboratively create digital artwork in real-time, mint it as a non-fungible token (NFT) on Lisk, and distribute fractional ownership using Arbitrum. This platform ensures transparent royalty distribution and shared ownership, empowering artists to collaborate creatively and securely.

## Features
- **Real-time Collaborative Canvas**: Multiple artists can create and edit artwork in real-time.
- **NFT Minting on Lisk**: The completed artwork is minted as an NFT on the Lisk blockchain.
- **Fractional Ownership on Arbitrum**: Ownership shares and royalties are distributed among collaborators via Arbitrum smart contracts.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Artwork and metadata are stored on IPFS for decentralized, secure storage.

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain**: Lisk, Arbitrum
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, Forge
- **Backend**: Lisk SDK, IPFS (Pinata or Infura)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js and npm
- Lisk SDK
- Arbitrum Development Environment
- IPFS CLI
- Foundry & Forge

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodeX042/METAMUSE.git
   cd collaborative-nft-art-platform

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install

2. **Start the local development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start

### Running the Application

3. **Launch Lisk and Arbitrum nodes:** Follow setup instructions for Lisk SDK and Arbitrum.

4. **Deploy the Arbitrum smart contracts with Forge:**
   - Ensure Forge is installed and set up by following the Foundry book.
   - Deploy contracts from the contracts folder:
   ```bash
   forge create --rpc-url <ARBITRUM_RPC_URL> --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> src/YourContract

## Smart Contract Development

Smart contracts in this project handle:

- **Fractional Ownership**: Distributing shares among contributors.
- **Royalty Distribution**: Automatically redistributing royalties to collaborators on resale.
